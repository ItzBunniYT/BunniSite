# BunniSite 

Created with React and Tailwind, based on create-react-app.

### How to run this project
Simply `yarn start` and React's compiler will do all of its' auto-compilation magic for you! It will automatically open a page in your browser to `localhost:3000` and will automatically compile your code on file save.

To create a production-ready build, simply run `yarn build` and React will compile and roll-up all of your code into the `build/` directory.
